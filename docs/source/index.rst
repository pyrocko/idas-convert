iDAS Convert
============

Convert and downsample distribute acousting sensing data (DAS) acquired by `Silixa iDAS <https://silixa.com/products/idas/>`_ to seismological data formats.
Main purpose is to quickly convert and downsample massive amounts of high-resolution TDMS data to MiniSeed.

To handle the massive amount of data generated by DAS interogators, the conversion tool is leveraging parallel IO and parallel processing.
On production systems a throughput of 200 MB/s while converting and downsampling (1 kHz -> 200 Hz) has been archived.

The seismological signal processing routines are based on the `Pyrocko <https://pyrocko.org>`_ framework, are mature and well tested.
