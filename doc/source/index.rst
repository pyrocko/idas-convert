iDAS TDMS Converter
===================

Convert and downsample distribute acoustic sensing (DAS) data acquired by `Silixa iDAS <https://silixa.com/products/idas/>`_ to seismological data formats.
Main purpose is to quickly convert and downsample massive amounts of high-resolution TDMS data to MiniSeed.

To handle the massive amount of data generated by DAS interrogators, the conversion tool is leveraging parallel IO and signal-processing processing.
On production systems a throughput of 200 MB/s can be archived while converting and downsampling (from 1 kHz to 200 Hz).

The signal processing routines are based on `Pyrocko <https://pyrocko.org>`_, mature and well tested seismological framework.
